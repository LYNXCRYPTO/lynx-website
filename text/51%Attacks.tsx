export default [`A 51% attack is perhaps the problem most feared in the blockchain industry because it allows for nodes to double spend. In a proof-of-work environment, 51% attacks occur when a single miner or mining group takes majority control of the network's hash power. If this were to take place, the attacker would be able to hijack the blockchain and ultimately confirm blocks with illegitimate transactions. Attacks like this require a significant amount of computing power and coordination which makes it extremely difficult to carry out. Similarly, in proof-of-stake based validation systems, a 51% attack takes place when a validator controls the majority of all staked currency in a given network. If done correctly, the attacker would be able to append faulty blocks to the blockchain and slash whatever stakes they please.\n\nIn proof-of-consensus, a 51% attack occurs when an individual or group is in possession of 51% of all node identities on the network. Fortunately, this is an extremely difficult task to accomplish due to the high electricity and storage costs that would be incurred on the attacker from repeatedly downloading the current state of an account. Additionally, the number of transaction approvals needed to be downloaded and signed to generate a proof of consensus increases exponentially with every added account made by the attacker. The number of approvals needed to be downloaded and signed by an attacker can be represented by this equation:`, "`A = (n * (n - 1)) + L`", `Let A represent the number of approvals needed to be downloaded and signed by an attacker,`, `Let n represent the number of actively participating accounts generated by the attacker,`, `Let L represent the number of actively participating accounts owned by the rest of the Lynx Network.`, `Unlike other blockchain protocols, proof-of-consensus does not incentivize mining pools. Due to the hash power necessary to provide a proof of consensus being limited to an account, it would be infeasible to coordinate a group of miners to share the rewards without having to have some amount of trust that the account who generated the proof of consensus would disperse those funds to the rest of the pool. As such, mining pools with 51% control of a network can not exist on Lynx.`]
