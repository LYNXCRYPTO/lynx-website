Compared to traditional network models where a central authority governs and regulates what information is able to be stored and transmitted on a platform, blockchain has distributed this power among its participants. However, in order to participate in most modern blockchain protocols, a node must meet two requirements:\n\n<b>Complete Ledger: </b>Each node must have a complete ledger or blockchain. Specifically, each node must synchronize their blockchain with the rest of the network before participating in important operations such as validation. This becomes an issue when a network matures and millions of transactions are included in the blockchain. For instance, Bitcoin’s current state includes 390 GB worth of information as of 2022, while the average mobile phone can store as much as 128 GB. Clearly, this limits accessibility to the network because individuals only in possession of performant hardware and a significant amount of disk space can participate.\n\n<b>Financial Stake: </b>Each node must stake something of value in order to become a network validator. In proof-of-stake systems, it is required that all participants provide upfront collateral as means for becoming a transaction validator. Networks that are developed using this model such as the highly anticipated Ethereum 2.0, require that nodes stake 32 ETH which is approximately $100,000 or 3 BTC. On the other hand, proof-of-work networks also require collateral, however, the stake amount is undefined and is directly correlated to the amount of cryptographic “work” a node is willing to contribute. Although both of these methods provide practical frameworks for validating transactions and securing a network, they provide innate financial barriers for less fortunate individuals to access a given peer-to-peer network.\n\nThese two issues are the primary limiting factors discouraging widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. As such, modifications to the current blockchain standard are unequivocally necessary in order to increase accessibility and decentralization of peer-to-peer networks.`
