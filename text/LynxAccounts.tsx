export default [`State on the Lynx Network is represented by account objects, with each account having a 64-byte address and state transitions being direct transfers of information between accounts. There are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts and contract accounts. Both of these accounts contains information pertaining to these four fields:`, `<b>Balance</b>, the amount of Lynx tokens (LX) owned by an address. The balance is not represented by an integer, instead a distributed state chain made up of the current and previous account states are stored. The balance can be determined by the account state at the top of the chain.`, `<b>Contract code</b>, if an account contains no smart contracts then this is an empty string.`, `<b>Storage</b>, empty by default.`, `Externally owned accounts are completely controlled by anyone in possession of the account's private key. On the other hand, contract accounts are deployed on the Lynx Network and are made publicly available for the network to interact with. `]
