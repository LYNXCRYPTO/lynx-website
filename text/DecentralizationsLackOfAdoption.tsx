We believe this is due to a number of failures inherent to existing blockchain frameworks such as issues relating to information centrality, scalability, accessibility, and extensibility.\n\n<b>Information Centrality: </b>The idea that information can only be managed and stored by one or very few individuals due to technological, geographical, or financial constraints. In regards to blockchain, only individuals in possession of premium hardware can store a complete ledger. As a network matures, it becomes exponentially more difficult for nodes to participate because of spatial constraints.\n\n<b>Scalability: </b>The ability for a network to efficiently manage throughput, especially during peak conditions when resources are exhausted. Due to the outdated mechanisms powering existing blockchain applications, networks are unable to meet demand when there are a significant amount of network requests submitted. Ultimately, this leads to a considerable decrease in throughput and exceedingly high fees.\n\n<b>Accessibility: </b>The quality of being able to connect to and participate on a network. Current consensus mechanisms require that all network participants provide a financial and/or spatial stake. In most blockchain environments, a complete ledger and financial stake of fiat or digital currency are required to actively participate in the validation of transactions.\n\n<b>Extensibility: </b>The ability to support a wide range of applications with new capabilities or functionalities. In current frameworks for decentralized applications, the number of network requests a user is able to make directly corresponds to their financial wellbeing. To put it simply, the more financially well off an individual is, the more use they can get out an application. In smart contract supported networks, this discrepancy exists because there are no alternative methods for nodes to provide the necessary computing power and storage to operate an application without requiring upfront transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, we intend to address all of these problems with improvements to the current framework of blockchain. That said, we believe that the Lynx Protocol will also serve as a vehicle for solving even more complex problems inherent to present decentralized applications as the idea further develops.`
