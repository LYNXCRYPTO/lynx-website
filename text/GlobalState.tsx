export default [`State is a term used to describe the particular condition a given system is in at a specific time. In blockchain applications, the state can be described as a “snapshot” that represents an entire blockchain after a new state transition occurs. State transitions in blockchain refer to the process of appending a new block to the end of the chain. Each block includes information relating to account balances, transactions, and storage. Usually, state is not determined by iterating through an entire blockchain because that would be extremely inefficient and timely as a blockchain grows. Instead, a cryptographic hash called a root hash is generated using the information contained in the newly appended block and the block preceding it. Since each block’s state includes the state of the previous block and thus all blocks in the blockchain, a root hash provides an exceptionally productive and secure method for representing state in blockchain applications.`, `In blockchain networks like Ethereum, state is represented using a data structure called a Modified Merkle Patricia Trie. This trie structure is responsible for generating root hashes representing core information essential to the functionality of the network. For instance, a specific Modified Merkle Patricia Trie, known as a World State Trie, is used to keep information relating to all Ethereum accounts up to date. The World State Trie can be seen as a global state that is constantly referred to and updated by transaction executions. It should be noted that when an Ethereum account is updated, the entire state of the network is changed as well.`]
