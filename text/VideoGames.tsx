Unlike blockchain-based games, nodes can provide computing power and storage for users without having to pay a fee for each network request. This provides for an optimal gaming experience because users will be less concerned about the financial risk involved with just casually playing the game. Utilizing a video game's subnetwork, a popular game can securely process user interaction by acting as a decentralized backend. Instead of directing all backend requests to a centralized server like traditional multiplayer video games, a player's request will be processed by the entire subnetwork. By making use of proof-of-consensus, a player will receive rapid responses from the network with extremely low latency. It should also be noted that since a subnetwork is decentralized, if outages were to occur, the network would still remain live. For as long as nodes exist on the subnetwork, the game should continue to run without interruption. \n\nCompetitive gaming has grown exponentially in the past decade with thousands of tournaments being held annually. However, due to the centralized nature of the operations necessary to run a tournament, competitors have not experienced a fair and quantitatively-based competitive setting. Utilizing Lynx's distributed ledger, smart contracts listening to in-game events can accurately depict the winner of a match and even distribute prize-money to competitors. Smart contracts can be replicated to be used for large-scale tournaments or minor wager matches involving just two individuals.`
