export default [`In Lynx, a global state does not exist and instead individual account states are utilized for performing network operations. All information related to the state of an account is recorded within a distributed state chain. A distributed state chain is a “lightweight blockchain” responsible for keeping track of state transitions for a given Lynx account. Unlike current blockchain applications, where all transactions, regardless of how unrelated they are, are included in a distributed ledger, distributed state chains strictly represent the current and past states of one account. Each state includes:`, `<b>Nonce</b>, a counter that keeps track of how many transactions an account has sent. This is important to prevent an account from spending the same transaction more than once.`, `<b>Previous State Reference</b>, a 64-byte SHA-512 hash of the previous state’s data.`, `<b>Current State Reference</b>, a 64-byte SHA-512 hash of the current state’s data.`, `<b>Account Balance</b>, the amount of Lynx tokens owned by an address during that particular state.`, `The <b>Transaction</b> responsible for facilitating the state transition.`, `It should be noted that since the current and previous states of an account are being chained together, it is not required for a node to maintain the entire history of an account. Instead, only the current state is necessary in order to process transactions for a given account.`]
