export default `The Lynx Network was originally conceived as a new protocol for decentralizing computation and storage for nodes. By enabling network participants with an incomplete ledger and lack of stake to participate in the validation of incoming transactions, centralization ceases to be an issue. Not only does the Lynx Protocol give more freedom to nodes to make well informed and independent decisions, but it provides the necessary tools for a network to handle rapid expansion. Additionally, the possibilities of applications utilizing the Lynx Network are endless with subnetwork parties enabling developers to provide computing power and storage to users without incurring a cost. Unlike other blockchain-based networks, applications with persistent network requests like multiplayer video games and video streaming will be able to exist in a decentralized manner. All things considered, the Lynx Network provides a next-level smart contract supported network with an array of new decentralized applications for the next generation of cryptocurrency.`
