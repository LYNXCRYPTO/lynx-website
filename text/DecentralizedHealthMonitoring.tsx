export default `The Internet of Things describes physical objects that monitor and exchange real world data with other devices and systems. Currently in decentralized applications, real world data is computed by oracle nodes, a group of specialized nodes who report on a datapoint. While this is a great solution for information that is public and readily available for anyone to retrieve, it fails to touch on information that is private like data relating to an individual’s health. Using sensors included in digital wearables such as Apple Watch, Fitbit, or Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, individuals can transmit their sensitive health information in an anonymous setting. The data collected can be aggregated and then used to identify unusual health patterns. By sending an alert to the user, an individual can seek medical attention to prevent a further decline in health. As this idea further develops, we plan to see technology specifically designed for this application in the form of implants and other various medical devices.`
