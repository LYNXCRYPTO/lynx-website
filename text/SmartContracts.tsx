export default `In reality, engaging in trade with another individual usually requires two things: a contract and a third party to ensure that there are no breaches of that contract. There are several problems inherent to this framework. First of all, both parties must have faith in each other to follow through with their end of the contract. This leads to even more discrepancies as there could be issues relating to interpretation of the contract, competency, and even time constraints. Additionally, both parties have to trust that the third party responsible for ensuring the contract does not act with malicious intent. For instance, a third party could intercept and steal the item of value being transferred or they could have a personal bias favoring one of the parties. All things considered, traditional contracts are exceptionally poor in assuring that both parties will execute. Fortunately, smart contracts provide a method for two parties to engage in trade without any trust being established.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts that are made publicly available on a blockchain. Similarly to a traditional contract, they include written terms of agreement between two parties. However, instead of the terms being inscribed on a legal document, they are directly written in lines of code. Since smart contracts run on a blockchain, they can not be controlled by a third party. Rather, a smart contract is considered self-executing as its code can only be run when certain conditions are met. Probably one of the most simple and popular analogies for smart contracts is to think of them as a vending machine. In this example, an individual provides an input, usually in the form of an item selection and money, and the machine dispenses your snack without another trusted person being present. This idea of an autonomous agent facilitating transactions can pertain to a greater number of applications relating to ownership, finance, and even governance. As such, smart contracts are essential to blockchain systems and provide a multitude of interfaces for individuals to interact with.`
