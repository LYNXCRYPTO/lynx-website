These problems have become exceptionally prominent recently due to the massive increase in usage of blockchain networks and its underlying technologies. We believe that these issues originate from existing frameworks for consensus and participation in modern blockchain protocols. This paper proposes a number of innovations to revitalize decentralized networks including an high performant blockchain architecture, custom subnetwork implementations, and a probabilistic BFT consensus mechanism for rapid transactional finality. By passively securing information through already essential interactions between nodes, we provide practical means for achieving rapid finality without undermining network efficiency. Additionally, by enabling nodes to access and participate on the network without requiring intensive financial or technological prerequisites, we introduce a “zero-barrier” entry point for all devices. All things considered, we put forward an open-source and readily accessible protocol for powering expeditious transfers of digital information across a scalable and secure network.`
