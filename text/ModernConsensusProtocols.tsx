export default `Current algorithms for consensus on peer-to-peer networks provide reliable methods for keeping information consistent among its participants. However, they do so by synchronizing a global state which all nodes use to validate transactions to build on top of the blockchain. By maintaining a common global state, nodes can continue to work together on processing transactions. However, an issue arises when a network is subject to a high amount of demand. This is because consensus for agreeing on a new state change can only be provided by one node. Thus, if there were an influx of transactions being submitted to the network, the burden of providing consensus would be limited to that node’s ability to collect transactions and propose a new block.\n\nSynchrony in current blockchain consensus mechanisms is devastating to the throughput of a network because it requires that all participants be in agreement before continuing their processes. This applies equally to the two main consensus algorithms: proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. Proof-of-work is an older consensus protocol primarily used by Bitcoin and Ethereum which involves the utilization of computational work to determine the current state of a blockchain. On the other hand, proof-of-stake, a more modern and green approach, involves delegating a network’s processing power to a subset of nodes called Validators. These particular  nodes have provided some form of monetary stake in order to take on the responsibility of maintaining the integrity of the network. Information is kept consistent by penalizing validators acting with malicious intent and rewarding honest validators for their contribution to the network.\n\nWhile staking provides its own set of challenges, synchrony on blockchain networks is primarily responsible for exacerbating limitations related to throughput. Therefore, it seems rational that one reasonable direction to explore, as a path to a more scalable and decentralized platform, is to provide methods in which network participants are able to asynchronously process transactions without undermining the security of the network. This is primarily how the Lynx Protocol plans to solve blockchain’s inherent problem of scalability.`
