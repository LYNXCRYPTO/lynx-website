export default `Transcoding a video can be a very expensive process. Itâ€™s one of the hidden costs that consumers do not see directly or understand. However, from a developer perspective, minimizing these costs are essential to the success of the underlying product. A solution to this problem is to distribute the computing power of streaming. By creating a party in which nodes are given video data to transcode, users can experience uninterrupted streams relating to their favorite topics. In order to provide this service, network transcoders must receive incentives proportional to the computing power they offer. These incentives can be given out in the form of network tokens. Combined with in-app monetization like platform-specific emoticons, video advertisements, or transaction fees from streamer donations, video miners can swap out their network tokens for LX pooled from those sources of income.`
