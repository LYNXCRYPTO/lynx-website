export default [`The act of modifying a distributive state chain for a given account would include any of the following actions:`, `Changing any information relating to a transaction such as its nonce, amount sent, to and from address, metadata, maximum gas usage, gas price, or digital signature.`, `Changing information relating to an account state included in a distributed state chain. Essentially, data pertaining to the last state referenced, hash of the current state, or the account’s balance.`, `Sending a false proof of consensus with invalid signatures.`, `All of these actions both result in the proof of consensus being inconsistent with the corresponding account state. If any transaction data was modified, the account state’s 512-bit hash along with any succeeding states’ hash would show that any amount of information was changed as the chain would be broken. Comparably, if any data pertaining to an account state was changed, its hash would also be inconsistent with subsequent account states.\n\nIf an attacker were to attempt to modify a proof of consensus provided by another node, it would be infeasible for them to do so because they would need access to their private key in order for the rest of the network to consider it valid. A way around this would be to randomly generate a 512-bit hash that would miraculously correspond with a Lynx account. However, the probability of this occurring is astronomically miniscule and would ultimately incur ridiculous financial costs to the attacker.`]
