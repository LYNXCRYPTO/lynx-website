export default `Mining in a proof-of-consensus system is very similar to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept as it involves utilizing a cryptographic function to provide evidence of consensus. However, what differentiates between the two and makes proof-of-consensus an exponentially more efficient and green solution is that the computational power used to process a transaction is strictly limited to the resources provided by the network. In proof-of-work, computational power is bounded by access to real world resources, usually in the form of electricity. However, since peer-to-peer networks are essentially virtual economies, its resources are purely virtual as well. In the case of Lynx, a node’s ability to sign incoming transaction approvals prohibits any excessive energy use because there are only so many participants on the network. If an attacker were to create an excessive amount of accounts and flood the network with approval attestations, then they only would be benefitting the network as they would provide more consensus while only incurring electricity and storage costs to themselves.`
