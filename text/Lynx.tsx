export default `The intent of Lynx is to create a rapidly scalable platform for developing decentralized applications, providing a number of key innovations that enable high throughput and security across a peer-to-peer network. Lynx does this by utilizing a new data structure called a distributed state chain as means for a public ledger. Combined with a new consensus protocol, proof-of-consensus, peers are able to add to their local ledger without the need for network synchrony. Unlike blockchain-based networks, Lynx is able to provide its users with fee-less computational power and storage through the use of application specific subnetworks. Nodes are then able to receive compensation proportionate to the amount of services they provide for a given application. This creates a significant amount of opportunities for “freemium” applications where users are not charged for using network storage. Additionally, like other Turing-complete platforms, Lynx allows for transfers of ownership, custom transaction formats, and state-transition functions made possible by smart contract deployment. With a plethora of innovations, Lynx plans to provide users with a high throughput, decentralized platform without the need for sacrificing its security.`
