export default `This paper is intended to be a technical overview of one of the many possible paths that may be taken in further advancing the current blockchain model, included with some reasoning as to why this direction is practical. It presents, in as much detail as possible, the components of blockchain technology which need to be revised along with their respective technical solutions.\nIt should be noted that this paper is not intended to be a formal specification or otherwise. It is not intended to be complete nor to be a final product. Additionally, this paper should not be expected to outline the nonessential components of the protocol like programming languages, APIs, or unrelated blockchain concepts. The several ideas covered in this paper will be subject to change or removal depending on how the community assesses them. This paper should be considered strictly experimental and only used as a blueprint for the initial development of the idea. It is expected that large portions of this paper will be revised as the concepts are implemented into real world applications.\n\nThis document includes a core description of the Lynx Protocol with potential concepts to consider for implementation. It is planned that the core description will be used as the basis for several proof-of-concepts. Furthermore, the minimum viable product would use this framework together with additional concepts provided by the community in order for the project to reach its goals.`
